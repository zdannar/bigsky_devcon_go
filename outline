Goals:
    "The efficientcy of a statically-typed compiled language with the ease of programming of a dynamic language"
    Rob Pike

History:

    Bell Labs:
        - Rob Pike
        - Ken Thomson
        - Robert Griesemer

    Project started late 2007
    By mid 2008 the language was designed.  compiler, runt-time

    Ian Lance Taylor and Russ Cox joined in 2008

(From Pike)
-> Fast programming,
-> Too long to compile
-> Fun.
-> Concurency.

* UTF8 By default.

Concurency:
"Is a way to build things. It is the composition of independantly executing processesthings, typically functions"
Tony Whore : 1978 Communicating Sequencial Processes.

    goroutines:
    channels:
    mutexes:

Interfaces vs OO:
    Duck Typing:
        'Walks like a duck!'

* Pointers.

Vendoring:
  Dave C's project.

Testing:
  - Make mention of Mitchell's Hashimoto's presention.

Interface:
    "A formalization of a set of methods" Rob Pike.


Concurrency is not parallelism
